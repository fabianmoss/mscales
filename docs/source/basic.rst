Basic objects
=============

.. note::
    Apart from the ``scales`` module discussed
    in Quickstart, ``mscales`` also contains the ``basic`` module.
    At the moment, they are alternatives with partially overlapping
    functionalities but they will be merged in the futured.
    
    As a rule of thumb, use the ``scales`` module whenever possible
    and only revert to ``basic`` when you need very specific things.
